# Crew

## Ideas
- crew member uniqueness through backpack utility and augentation possibilities

- Spin, if the wreck spins, gravity can increase on the ship - maybe, when docking with bigger ships,
  you need to spend more fuel to decrease the risk of entering a spin. Spinning makes moving require more oxygen.

- Bolide strike - Bolides can strike with a few turns warning. A bolide strike sucks air out of chaimbers with open doors
  and causes radiation to leak around a ship.
  
- Every two "turns" a crew member that has been inactive for the last two turns will use oxygen passively, making it a good idea
  make use of every crew member
  
- Ship alarm systems can activate with some warning - triggering defense systems and sealing doors
  - a crew member trapped in a room with a "turret" or "defense system" will refuse to move until the alarm has been deactivated
  - alarms defense systems can be deactivated from outside the room

- space suits with heat ratings, for hot missions

- space suits with radiation ratings, for radioactive missions

- strength augmentation equipment for operating in high "spin" environments

- stealth equipment for avoiding ship defense systems

- E.M.P item for disabling a radius of systems. It also disables items

- You dont start with oxygen tanks

## Gameplay

Crew members will report the status back to you, you must order
them to take an action.

Rooms only visible when you get to them, making it hard to plan
how much oxygen you're going to need.

### O2
- Use oxygen every time you move to a new room
- Need enough O2 to get in and out again
- Doing anything physical costs O2
- Getting stressed costs more O2

### Actionable things
- Room type
- loot (of any kind)
- Hazards: Fire, Radiation,

#### What does Tank do?
- Looks at blueprints for buildings to find exits
- Looks at maps of areas
- Tracks enemies
- Looks out for the ship
- Sets up exit points
